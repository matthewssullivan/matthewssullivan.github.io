  <p> Hello and welcome to my website! Please pardon the mess, I've just started learning HTML this month
  and this website is my testground. As I'm always trying to broaden my knowledge base, I didn't want to use
  a website maker or Jekyll as a cheat (I apologize in advance for my taste in colors/themes).  </p>
  <p> By way of introduction, my name is Matt Sullivan and I'm currently pursuing my Masters of Computer Science at University of Colorado
  Denver (Class of 2020). I've worked in multiple industries in both the public and private sector, and while it took me
  a while to find my niche, I'm eager to catch up by learning all that I can about computer science.
  If you'd like to know more about me personally, please head over to the "About me" link or 
  <a href="aboutme.html"> click here</a>.</p>
  <p> This website serves as a repository for my programming projects, both <a href="schoolprogramming.html">school assignments</a>
  and <a href="personal.html">personal</a>. It also contains examples of my <a href="reports.html"> analysis and reports</a>
   I have been assigned in classes throughout the last couple years. I hope you find it easy to navigate and that you enjoy the content. I will
  continue updating this website as I create new material (and as I can, class deadlines permitting).  </p>
  <p> Since this is my initial post, I'll keep a copy of it at the top. Further updates will work chronologically
  backwards from here. Who knows? With enough work I might actually get a scrolling blog going here. Maybe
  a few pictures to spruce up the place...  </p>

  <h6> CHANGELOG: Added both sidebars and created .css file. Made initial post and updated link to
  Computer Architecture page (with first report)</h6>

    <p>I didn't originally have a right sidebar, but the balance of the webpage seemed off, so I added this to the right side where ads would normally be. Symmetry makes me happy.</p>
