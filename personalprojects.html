     <h3>This Website</h3>
		<p> I started this website both as an information center for people new to my work, and as a crash
		course in HTML</p>
		<p> I'd give you a link, but clearly you've already found it</p>

	<h3>Dice Rolling Simulator</h3>
	  <p> I Started this project over Christmas Break. It's a simulator for FFG's 3 axis 7 dice system which
	  they developed for their Star Wars RPG. I also wanted to use it to work on my GUI skills using Python. It's
	  currently working, but since I am working on it for GUI interface I haven't made a non-GUI input. It's located
	  somewhere towards the back burner currently, but I hope to finish it not long after the semester ends.</p>
