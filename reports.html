	  <h3> Machine Learning Final Project</h3>
	  <p> This was my Final Project for my Machine Learning Class. In it I designed a CNN to analyze pictures of faces and categorize them as "photoshopped" or genuine (non-photoshopped).</p>

     <h3>Analysis of Naive Sort vs Merge Sort</h3>
		<p> This was an assignment for my Algorithms class. Using C++, I wrote a program to compare the performance
		of a naive sort (bubble sort) vs a better sorting algorithm (merge sort)</p>

	<h3>Analysis of Searching Algorithms</h3>
		<p> This was an assignment for my Algorithms class. Using Python, I wrote a program to compare the performance
		of searching an unsorted list, vs a sorted list, vs using a list indexed in a hash table</p>

	<h3>Cybersecurity Lab</h3>
		<p> Our first assignment in Cybersecurity Programming and Analysis was to design and implement a lab. It
		is designed for our class, which used VMware to power Kali versions of Linux, and was designed to demonstrate
		the use of one of the built in tools contained in Kali Linux. The lab was intended to be a standalone word document
		(converted into PDF here) containing the links, commands, and programs (python) that a student would need to
		successfully complete the lab if they had the VMware with the installed Virtual Machine.</p>

		<h3>Cybersecurity Analysis 1</h3>
		<p> This was my final paper for my Cybersecurity Programming and Analysis class. In it, I examine the
		2011 and 2014 hack on Sony</p>

		<h3>Cybersecurity Analysis 2</h3>
		<p> This was my first assignment for my Cyber/Infrastructure Defence class. In it, I examine a potential attack
		using voice operated interfaces, as well as a summary of the NotPetya attack in the Ukraine in 2017</p>
