	<h3>More facts in the form of a <a href="Matthew Sullivan Resume3-2019.pdf">Resume</a></h3>
	
	<p>I'm a 31 year old Chicago to Colorado transplant and aspiring computer scientist currently looking to gain industry experience and make
	meaningful contributions with a full-time summer or part-time year long internship.</p>
	<p>I've started careers in several sectors, including health care, law enforcement, and the military.
	While each had it's ups and downs, I never felt like I'd found where I belonged until I started coding 
	in earnest. I'm very excited about starting my new career and putting my knowledge to use.</p>
    <p> I'd love to say I have a ton of personal projects in the works. The truth is, between school assignments,
	working full time (up until this past fall), and my two sons (both under 5), my hobbies include "Sitting down"
	and "wistfully thinking of past (and hopefully) future days where my schedule isn't so crazy."</p>
	<p>In the slight sliver of time when I'm not "Dading", doing homework, or sleeping, I enjoy reading (mostly
	Science Fiction), playing the occasional video game, and trying to con friends or family into playing a
	board game or tabletop RPG.</p>
